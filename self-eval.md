# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
- This was definitely a significant challenge. As I approached the issue it seemed daunting, however as I tackled it piece by piece it started to get a lot more doable. I thinik vocabulary fluency and practiing my syntax are big right now.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
- Work flow is going well. I can definitely learn to productive struggle better! Right now I need to devise better strategies at tacklign a problem from different angles. I find myself looking at it 1 way for too long.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
- Everything! I think first and foremost the actual syntax of it all. I need to get better at how I code everything and making sure that I am not inputing small syntax errors.
